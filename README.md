## Current Implementation for RAD 
### Game Prototype
1. Currently the notes fall down screen and players can use the CVBN keys to hit the falling notes
2. Bottom half of screen flashes red when player misses note. When player health reaches 0, game is over 
3. Boss takes damage when player hits the notes; different ranks (bad, good, perfect) do different damage. When boss health reaches 0, game continues until song ends
